After reading the django docs i tried to build a basic blog for myself

# Django Blog

Welcome to the Django Blog project! This is a simple blog application built using Django, where users can create posts with titles, dates, and content.

## Installation

To get started with the Django Blog project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone <repository_url> && cd django-blog


2. **Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Run migrations:**
python manage.py makemigrations &&
python manage.py migrate


4. **Create a superuser (admin):**
python manage.py createsuperuser


5. **Start the development server:**
python manage.py runserver


6. **Access the admin interface:**
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`
- Log in with the superuser credentials created in step 4.
- Here you can manage posts, users, and other site content.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the blog at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. From there, you can:

- View existing blog posts.
- Create new blog posts.
- Edit or delete existing blog posts (accessible through the admin interface).

## Contributing
